###Low-Level Project Plan - Branch and Bound for Motif Discovery
##a) Problem Understanding
#1. Goal Definition

    Identify conserved motifs of fixed length (k-mers) across a set of sequences.
    Use the Branch and Bound approach to efficiently search for the best motif, avoiding exhaustive enumeration.
    Ensure the motif is found with optimal alignment positions across sequences to maximize similarity.

#2. Motif Scoring

    The scoring function measures motif quality based on conservation across sequences.
    Common scoring methods include:
        Consensus Score: Counts the most frequent nucleotide at each position.
        Information Content: Measures conservation using entropy-based calculations.

#3. Search Space Pruning

    Instead of checking all motif positions, the Branch and Bound approach eliminates search paths that cannot lead to an optimal solution, significantly improving efficiency.

##b) Design
#1. Search Space Representation

    Represent all possible k-length motifs as potential candidates.
    Use a tree-based search where each branch corresponds to a possible motif extension.

#2. Scoring Function

    Implement a scoring function to evaluate motif quality, ensuring biologically meaningful motifs are identified.

#3. Pruning Strategy

    Upper Bound Estimation: Before exploring deeper into the search space, compute an upper-bound score for partial motifs.
    Early Termination: If the upper bound of a partial solution is lower than the best-known score, discard that branch to save computation.

#4. Handling Edge Cases

    Short Sequences: If sequences are shorter than the motif length, return an error or handle gracefully.
    Completely Mismatched Sequences: If no meaningful motif is found, ensure the algorithm handles it correctly.
    Large Datasets: Implement optimizations to handle larger sequence sets efficiently.

##c) Implementation
#1. Branch and Bound Algorithm

    Implement a recursive or iterative Branch and Bound search.
    Maintain a priority queue (or similar structure) to efficiently manage promising candidates.

#2. Motif Extraction Function

    Extract the best motif from sequences based on the highest score.
    Return the optimal motif positions along with the alignment score.

#3. Customizable Parameters

    Allow users to set:
        Motif Length (k)
        Scoring Metric (Consensus Score, Information Content)
        Alphabet Type (DNA or Protein sequences)

##d) Validation
#1. Unit Tests

Develop unit tests to validate the implementation, covering:

    Basic Tests: Simple sequences with known motifs (e.g., "ACGTG" vs "ACGTT").
    Edge Cases: Empty sequences, single-sequence inputs, and sequences with varying lengths.
    Expected Results: Compare results with reference motif discovery tools.

#2. Performance Tests

    Measure runtime and memory usage on large datasets.
    Verify correctness by printing the motif matrix and comparing with known biological motifs.
