# High-Level Project Plan - Gibbs Sampling for Motif Discovery
## 1. Description

This project focuses on implementing Gibbs Sampling, a stochastic algorithm for motif discovery in biological sequences. Motif discovery is crucial for identifying conserved patterns in DNA or protein sequences, which often correspond to functional biological elements such as transcription factor binding sites.

Gibbs Sampling uses a probabilistic approach to iteratively refine motif selection, making it an efficient alternative to exhaustive search methods like Branch and Bound or brute-force algorithms. The method balances exploration and exploitation, allowing it to escape local optima and find biologically meaningful motifs even in noisy data.

## 2. Key Features of the Project

- **Stochastic Motif Discovery**: Uses Gibbs Sampling to iteratively refine motif positions based on probability distributions.
- **Flexible Motif Length (k-mers)**: Allows users to specify the motif length.
- **Profile-based Scoring**: Utilizes position-specific scoring matrices (PSSM) to probabilistically select motif positions.
- **Probabilistic Sampling**: Instead of deterministic updates, the algorithm randomly selects motifs based on calculated probabilities, improving its ability to escape local optima.
- **Handling of DNA and Protein Sequences**: Supports both DNA (A, C, G, T) and protein sequences using substitution matrices.
- **Unit Testing**: Includes test cases for verifying correctness, convergence, and performance.

The project provides an efficient and adaptive motif discovery tool, making it useful for researchers in genomics, transcriptomics, and molecular biology.

# Low-Level Project Plan - Gibbs Sampling for Motif Discovery
## a) Problem Understanding
### 1. Goal Definition

- Identify conserved motifs of fixed length (k-mers) across a set of sequences.
- Use Gibbs Sampling, a probabilistic approach, to iteratively improve motif selection.
- Optimize motif positions to maximize sequence similarity while avoiding exhaustive searches.

### 2. Motif Scoring

- Use a profile matrix (PSSM) to compute the likelihood of different motif positions.
- Common scoring methods include:
    - **Consensus Score**: Measures motif conservation based on the most frequent nucleotide at each position.
    - **Information Content**: Evaluates motif conservation using entropy-based calculations.

### 3. Iterative Refinement

- Gibbs Sampling alternates between random motif exclusion and probabilistic motif selection to refine motif discovery.

## b) Design
### 1. Profile Construction

- Compute a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) based on the current set of motifs.
- Use pseudocounts to avoid zero probabilities.

### 2. Motif Selection Strategy

- Randomly exclude one sequence from motif selection.
- Compute the profile matrix from the remaining motifs.
- Use the profile to probabilistically select a new motif from the excluded sequence.

### 3. Convergence Criteria

- Terminate when the motif positions stabilize (no improvement over several iterations).
- Use stagnation detection to stop early if no improvement is observed for a given number of iterations.

### 4. Handling Edge Cases

- **Short Sequences**: If sequences are shorter than the motif length, return an error or handle gracefully.
- **Completely Mismatched Sequences**: If no meaningful motif is found, ensure the algorithm handles it correctly.
- **Random Initialization Sensitivity**: Mitigate local optima by running multiple trials with different initial motifs.

## c) Implementation
### 1. Profile Matrix Computation

- Implement a function to compute nucleotide probabilities at each motif position.
- Use pseudocounts to ensure stability.

### 2. Probability Distribution for Motif Selection

- Compute relative probabilities for each possible motif position using the profile matrix.
- Use weighted random sampling to probabilistically select new motif positions.

### 3. Iterative Gibbs Sampling Process

- Randomly initialize motif positions.
- Iterate until convergence:
    - Randomly remove one motif.
    - Compute a new profile matrix without the removed motif.
    - Sample a new motif probabilistically.
    - Repeat until motifs stabilize or the maximum iteration limit is reached.

### 4. Customizable Parameters

- Allow users to configure:
    - **Motif Length (k)**
    - **Scoring Metric** (Consensus Score, Information Content)
    - **Number of Iterations**
    - **Stagnation Limit** (to stop early if no improvement)

## d) Validation
### 1. Unit Tests

Develop unit tests to validate the implementation, covering:

- **Basic Tests**: Simple sequences with known motifs (e.g., "ACGTG" vs "ACGTT").
- **Edge Cases**: Empty sequences, single-sequence inputs, and sequences with varying lengths.
- **Expected Results**: Compare results with reference motif discovery tools.

### 2. Performance Tests

- Measure runtime and memory usage on large datasets.
- Verify correctness by printing the motif matrix and comparing with known biological motifs.
