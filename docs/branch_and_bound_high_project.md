# High-Level Project Plan - Branch and Bound for Motif Discovery
## 1. Description

This project focuses on implementing the Branch and Bound algorithm for motif discovery in biological sequences. Motif discovery is crucial in bioinformatics for identifying conserved sequence patterns in DNA or protein sequences, which often correspond to functional biological elements like transcription factor binding sites.

The Branch and Bound method efficiently searches for the most conserved motif across multiple sequences by systematically pruning unpromising search paths, ensuring an optimal solution without exhaustive enumeration.

## 2. Key Features of the Project

- **Efficient Motif Discovery**: Uses Branch and Bound to identify the most conserved motif across multiple sequences.
- **Optimal Alignment**: Guarantees finding the best motif by eliminating unnecessary search paths.
- **Pruning Strategy**: Reduces computational complexity compared to brute-force motif search.
- **Scoring Function**: Uses a scoring metric (e.g., information content or consensus strength) to evaluate motif quality.
- **Handling of DNA and Protein Sequences**: Supports both DNA (A, C, G, T) and protein sequences using substitution matrices when needed.
- **Unit Testing**: Validates the algorithm using predefined test cases, ensuring correctness and efficiency.

The project aims to provide a fast and reliable motif discovery tool, making it a useful resource for researchers in genomics, transcriptomics, and molecular biology.
