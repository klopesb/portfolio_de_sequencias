# High-Level Project Plan - Branch and Bound for Motif Discovery
## 1. Description

This project focuses on implementing the Branch and Bound algorithm for motif discovery in biological sequences. Motif discovery is crucial in bioinformatics for identifying conserved sequence patterns in DNA or protein sequences, which often correspond to functional biological elements like transcription factor binding sites.

The Branch and Bound method efficiently searches for the most conserved motif across multiple sequences by systematically pruning unpromising search paths, ensuring an optimal solution without exhaustive enumeration.

## 2. Key Features of the Project

- **Efficient Motif Discovery**: Uses Branch and Bound to identify the most conserved motif across multiple sequences.
- **Optimal Alignment**: Guarantees finding the best motif by eliminating unnecessary search paths.
- **Pruning Strategy**: Reduces computational complexity compared to brute-force motif search.
- **Scoring Function**: Uses a scoring metric (e.g., information content or consensus strength) to evaluate motif quality.
- **Handling of DNA and Protein Sequences**: Supports both DNA (A, C, G, T) and protein sequences using substitution matrices when needed.
- **Unit Testing**: Validates the algorithm using predefined test cases, ensuring correctness and efficiency.

The project aims to provide a fast and reliable motif discovery tool, making it a useful resource for researchers in genomics, transcriptomics, and molecular biology.

# Low-Level Project Plan - Branch and Bound for Motif Discovery
## a) Problem Understanding
### 1. Goal Definition

- Identify conserved motifs of fixed length (k-mers) across a set of sequences.
- Use the Branch and Bound approach to efficiently search for the best motif, avoiding exhaustive enumeration.
- Ensure the motif is found with optimal alignment positions across sequences to maximize similarity.

### 2. Motif Scoring

- The scoring function measures motif quality based on conservation across sequences.
- Common scoring methods include:
    - Consensus Score: Counts the most frequent nucleotide at each position.
    - Information Content: Measures conservation using entropy-based calculations.

### 3. Search Space Pruning

- Instead of checking all motif positions, the Branch and Bound approach eliminates search paths that cannot lead to an optimal solution, significantly improving efficiency.

## b) Design
### 1. Search Space Representation

- Represent all possible k-length motifs as potential candidates.
- Use a tree-based search where each branch corresponds to a possible motif extension.

### 2. Scoring Function

- Implement a scoring function to evaluate motif quality, ensuring biologically meaningful motifs are identified.

### 3. Pruning Strategy

- Upper Bound Estimation: Before exploring deeper into the search space, compute an upper-bound score for partial motifs.
- Early Termination: If the upper bound of a partial solution is lower than the best-known score, discard that branch to save computation.

### 4. Handling Edge Cases

- Short Sequences: If sequences are shorter than the motif length, return an error or handle gracefully.
- Completely Mismatched Sequences: If no meaningful motif is found, ensure the algorithm handles it correctly.
- Large Datasets: Implement optimizations to handle larger sequence sets efficiently.

## c) Implementation
### 1. Branch and Bound Algorithm

- Implement a recursive or iterative Branch and Bound search.
- Maintain a priority queue (or similar structure) to efficiently manage promising candidates.

### 2. Motif Extraction Function

- Extract the best motif from sequences based on the highest score.
- Return the optimal motif positions along with the alignment score.

### 3. Customizable Parameters

- Allow users to set:
    - Motif Length (k)
    - Scoring Metric (Consensus Score, Information Content)
    - Alphabet Type (DNA or Protein sequences)

## d) Validation
### 1. Unit Tests

Develop unit tests to validate the implementation, covering:

- Basic Tests: Simple sequences with known motifs (e.g., "ACGTG" vs "ACGTT").
- Edge Cases: Empty sequences, single-sequence inputs, and sequences with varying lengths.
- Expected Results: Compare results with reference motif discovery tools.

### 2. Performance Tests

- Measure runtime and memory usage on large datasets.
- Verify correctness by printing the motif matrix and comparing with known biological motifs.
